## Reflection 

## What advice would I give to myself if I was to start a project like this again?

- I wasted a lot of time, just thinking how I would want to do this project, trying too much on making the vector movement perfect. If I managed my time better I could have done this better. 
- I made things way too long for no reason, I should have made some things less complicated. 

## Did I complete everything in my "needs to have" list?
- Yes, I got everything in my needs to have list, I also got things that weren't even on either lists. 

## What was the hardest part of the project?
- The hardest part I'd say was the math figuring the way the snakes move and also the way they collided with each other. To make so many functions for different things was painstaking. 

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
- Yes, there is one weird bug that I could not solve which was, as you keep playing the game just keeps getting choppier and slower.
