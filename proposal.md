# Major Project 


## Description 
I am going to be making a rip-off Slither.io! 
This game will contain a snake roaming around the screen trying to eat the "food" to grow, and have a button for adding a couple of other
snakes which will try to kill you by eating more and cutting. 

## Needs to Have List 
- A working snake, with the appropriate snake-like movement. 
- Whole bunch of food scattered everywhere for you to gobble up and grow!
- Growing the snake as it eats more food 
- Adding more snakes for you to fight to play further 
- 

## Nice to Have List 
- Having a "boss" level which would be pretty hard to win
- Making the "area-cut-kill" logic as in the actual game
-
