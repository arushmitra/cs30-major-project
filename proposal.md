# Major Project 


## Description 
I am going to be making a rip-off Flappy Bird! 
This game will be like the one we've all played on our phones over the years and still love to play to kill some time. 
You will have to hit the mouse to keep the bird up in the sky and not hit the poles and die. 
As you progress, the speed of the bird will gradually increase. 

## Needs to Have List 
- A good bird sprite
- A pipe sprite of different lengths and in random places 

## Nice to Have List 
- thing 3
- thing 4
